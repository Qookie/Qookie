I hope everything's going well with you. I've been feeling a bit off lately and just wanted to share, given how well you always seem to understand.
Last week was a whirlwind at work. After dedicating months to this big project, I was hopeful about the outcome. But the feedback was less than stellar. Instead of seeing it as a one-off event, it's been hard not to question my own abilities and wonder if I'm somehow always falling short.
I've even been eyeing this professional development course, thinking it might be a good way to bolster my skills. But there's this nagging feeling in the back of my mind: am I too rooted in my current ways to adapt and learn something new?
And just as I was processing all of this, a new, challenging assignment landed on my desk. It's made me second-guess whether I'm equipped to handle it, especially given my recent setback.
I know I'm probably overthinking things, and that's partly why I wanted to write to you. You've always had a clear head and a way of offering perspective. Maybe you'll have some insights or advice, or perhaps just writing this out will help me find clarity.
Thanks for always being a listening ear and a steady presence in my life.
