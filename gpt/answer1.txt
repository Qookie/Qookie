Thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts with me, it takes a lot of courage to open up about your concerns. I appreciate your trust in me to guide you through this challenging time.
In situations like these, I often recommend using the Albert Ellis' ABC model as a tool to understand and manage our emotional responses. This cognitive behavioral therapy technique suggests that it isn't the activating event (A) that causes our emotional and behavioral consequences (C), but our beliefs (B) about the event.
In your case, the activating event (A) was the feedback on your project. Your emotional consequence (C) is your self-doubt and anxiety about your abilities. The key to managing your feelings here lies in examining your beliefs (B) about the situation.
You believe that your worth and abilities are tied to the success of your project. This is a common belief among many professionals, but it's crucial to remember that one project or feedback doesn't define your overall abilities or value. One setback does not mean you are incapable or always falling short.
It's also important to remember that professional growth involves continuous learning. Considering a professional development course is an excellent idea, and it's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about learning something new. However, it's essential to challenge the belief that you might be too rooted in your ways to adapt. Adaptability and learning are not age-specific or time-specific.
When it comes to your new assignment, it's natural to feel anxious, especially after a setback. However, try to see it as an opportunity to apply your skills and learn from the experience rather than a test of your capabilities.
Your self-awareness and ability to reflect on your feelings is a strength. It's okay to question and doubt sometimes, but it's also crucial to challenge these thoughts and beliefs. Remember, setbacks are a part of growth, and they do not define your worth or capabilities.
I hope these insights help. Please feel free to share further thoughts or concerns, if any.
